<p>Things that I would expand upon before moving into production</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>Concatenate, obfuscation and minimize everything to a dist folder for testing and rollout</li>
    <li>Use browsersync to see changes in realtime in multiple sizes/resolutions</li>
    <li>Much more mock data and a better mock back end for http calls</li>
    <li>Perhaps use the foundation grid system, not bootstrap</li>
    <li>Break up functionality into directives.  Presently no directives exist.</li>
    <li>Better organize files into folders/modules and keep 3rd party vendor assets better organized with production ready versions.</li>
    <li>Remove a few various, unnecessary things I left in or complete using them</li>
    <li>Add automated, acceptance tests and ensure complete code coverage with a tool including the use of mock data</li>
    <li>It needs the "hamburger" menu item at a mobile resolution</li>
    <li>A real CSS style sheet, compiled from SASS file(s)</li>
    <li>Have a nightly build that ran all server and client side tests and sent a report via email</li>
    <li>The expand page layout is only OK, and doesn't look great at all resolutions.</li>
    <li>The form fields are very basic obviously, and needs a lot better client-side validation.</li>
    <li>Much, much, more</li>
</ul>
