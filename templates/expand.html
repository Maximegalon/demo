<p>Things that I would expand upon before moving into production</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>Minimize and obfuscation the JavaScript code</li>
    <li>Break up functionality into directives</li>
    <li>Better organize files into folders/modules and keep 3rd party vendor assets better organized</li>
    <li>Use template caching</li>
    <li>Remove various, unnecessary things I left in or complete using them</li>
    <li>Add automated, acceptance tests and ensure complete code coverage with a tool including the use of mock data</li>
    <li>It needs the "hamburger" menu item at a mobile resolution</li>
    <li>A real CSS style sheet, compiled from SASS file(s)</li>
    <li>Have a nightly build that ran all server and client side tests and sent a report via email</li>
    <li>Much, much, more</li>
</ul>
